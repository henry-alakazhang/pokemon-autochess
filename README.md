An autochess game themed after Pokemon.

Play at https://henry-alakazhang.github.io/pokemon-autochess

I don't own the concept of Pokemon, the sprites, or anything else related to Pokemon. Those belong to GameFreak, The Pokemon Company and Nintendo. I'm well aware such disclaimers don't really mean anything, but oh well.

There's a trello board here with all the stuff I'm planning: https://trello.com/b/ncSePCMD/pokemon-autochess
Feel free to create an issue, then a PR if you want to add some code. There's a `standalone` tag for good tasks that aren't dependent on anything else.
